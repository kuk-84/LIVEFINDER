# LIVEFINDER
The primary focus of this project was the development and testing of an Android application using React Native to meet the needs of users seeking real-time tracking of vehicles and trains, coupled with access to departure time information and timely reminder notifications. The application, aptly named Live Finder, was thoughtfully divided into two distinct sections: Roadways Tracking and Railways Tracking.

Roadways Tracking: Integrated real-time traffic data from Google API's distance matrix to provide accurate travel time estimations. Users could plan their trips considering current traffic conditions, optimizing their travel experience.

Railways Tracking: Integrated with Roadways Tracking, providing real-time train arrival and departure information for various train stations. Push notifications informed users of the optimal time to leave home, ensuring timely arrivals.
